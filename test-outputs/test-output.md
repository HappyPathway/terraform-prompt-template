## Best Practices
- Use a linter like ESLint with a strict configuration to enforce code style and catch potential errors.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting across the project.
- Use TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
- Write unit and integration tests using a testing framework like Jest and React Testing Library.
- Use a component library like Material UI or Ant Design for pre-built components and styling.
- Implement a state management solution like Redux or Zustand for complex state logic.
- Use a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components or Emotion for easier styling and dynamic styles.
- Optimize images and other assets to improve loading performance.
- Use a build tool like Webpack or Parcel to bundle the application for production.
- Use a version control system like Git and follow a consistent branching strategy.

## GitHub Copilot Instructions
Generate React components, hooks, and utility functions for fetching weather data, displaying weather information, handling user interactions, and managing application state. Follow best practices for React development, including using functional components with hooks, managing state efficiently, and writing clean, reusable code. Implement appropriate error handling and loading states. Use TypeScript for type safety and improved code maintainability. Write unit and integration tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the code. Adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to make the application usable for everyone. Optimize the application for performance, including minimizing bundle size, optimizing images and other assets, and using efficient rendering techniques. Consider using a component library like Material UI or Ant Design for pre-built components and styling. Implement a state management solution like Redux or Zustand if necessary for complex state logic. Use a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components or Emotion for easier styling and dynamic styles. Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices. Follow a consistent coding style and use a linter like ESLint to enforce code quality. Write clear and concise documentation for the project, including a README file with instructions on how to run and use the application. Use a version control system like Git and follow a consistent branching strategy.
