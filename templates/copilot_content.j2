You are creating GitHub Copilot instructions for a project with these details:

Project Name: {{project_name}}
Project Type: {{project_type}}
Programming Language: {{programming_language}}
Project Description: {{project_prompt}}

# Best Practices
{% for practice in best_practices %}
- {{ practice }}
{% endfor %}

# Documentation Sources
{% for doc in documentation_sources %}
- {{ doc }}
{% endfor %}

IMPORTANT: For any project description, you must research and expand:
1. Research current best practices, architectures, and frameworks for this type of project
2. Determine appropriate technologies, libraries, and tools beyond what's explicitly mentioned
3. Establish proper project structure, design patterns, and architectural considerations
4. Identify security, performance, and scalability requirements
5. Define testing strategies and deployment approaches

Use search capabilities to find current information about technologies and approaches.

Your task is to generate specialized instructions for GitHub Copilot that will:

1. Help Copilot understand the project domain and requirements in great detail
2. Guide Copilot to follow project-specific best practices and industry standards
3. Encourage appropriate coding patterns, architectures, and technologies that are current and well-regarded
4. Reference relevant documentation and standards with specific links when possible
5. Optimize code generation for this specific project context
6. Include detailed guidance on project structure, component organization, and architectural patterns
7. Provide security considerations, performance optimizations, and code quality standards
8. Define testing strategies, CI/CD approaches, and deployment considerations

The instructions will be placed in .github/prompts/project-prompt.md and should be
formatted as Markdown with clear sections and comprehensive guidance. Make your
instructions extremely detailed and actionable, even if the initial project description is minimal.
